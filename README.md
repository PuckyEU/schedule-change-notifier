# VŠEM Schedule Change Notifier
This is a simple script that notifies you when the schedule changes on the [**VŠEM website**](https://www.akademievsem.cz/).
Because of the schedule being changed so often, I decided to make a script that would notify me when the schedule changes.
It checks every hour to see if the schedule has changed, and if it has, it emails you.
The script will be running on a server, and the email will be sent to the email address you send the email to subscribe from.

## How to use
The script will email the schedule to the email address you send the email from. So send the email from the email address you want to receive the schedule at. But don't worry, the script will not send any other emails to that address.

[**Send an Email**](mailto:info@vsemschedulechangenotifier.tech) to the email address `info@vsemschedulechangenotifier.tech` with the subject `subscribe` to **subscribe** to the service.

[**Send an Email**](mailto:info@vsemschedulechangenotifier.tech) to the email address `info@vsemschedulechangenotifier.tech` with the subject `unsubscribe` to **unsubscribe** from the service.
