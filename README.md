# VŠEM Schedule Change Notifier
This is a simple script that notifies you when the schedule changes on the [**VŠEM website**](https://www.akademievsem.cz/). 
It checks every hour to see if the schedule has changed, and if it has, it emails you.
The script will be running on a server, and the email will be sent to the email address you provide.
It does not send the emails yet, but it will soon.
